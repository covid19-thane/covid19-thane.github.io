On 21 July, I was tested positive for covid19.

While I was under treatment, one of my friend 

contiuned updating the dashboard.

Though Fortunately, I recovered from it recently.

But everything isn't same anymore...

You might have wondering Why now a days 

data on thane dashboard link is not getting updated?

The reason is,

Maintaining this project without much of contributions was really hard!

Getting true information and reliable content was also a challenge.

Therefore, I've decided to shut down this project.

In case you want to get in touch with me for future collaboration, please find the contact details below.

I hope that my efforts were helpful to keep you informed.

### Stay Home , Stay Safe , Stay Calm , Be Informed.

### Remember !
Its not about who shares the information first!
"Its about sharing the correct,authentic & verified information"
People usually forward messages without checking its source/authenticity
This creates unusual panic in the society
So think about it before you forward.
